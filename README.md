# GrapQL API

**Introduction**: This is my first GraphQL API. It contains basic Auth functionalities(signup and login), get a user details query and get all users query.

## To test locally:
1. Clone this repository
2. Create a .env file and add the required variables(see .env.example for details).
3. Run npm start
4. Use Apollo sandbox to test the api

**I hosted live on render: `https://gql-api.onrender.com` and created a graph for it om my apollo account. But only those in my organisation can view it
due to my plan currently. Meet me in the future ðŸš€ for a bigger plan, so you can access it remotelyðŸ˜Ž
